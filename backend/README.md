# Food Order - Backend

This is the backend service for the **Food Order** application, designed to support a food ordering system for hotel services. It manages API requests, database operations, authentication, and business logic for both the customer-facing front office and the hotel management back office.

## Features

The backend provides the following functionalities:

### API Endpoints

- **Authentication**
  - User login and registration with JWT-based authentication.
  - Role-based access control (customer, manager, admin).
  
- **Order Management**
  - Create, view, update, and delete orders.
  - Track the status of customer orders (e.g., Pending, Confirmed, Delivered).
  - Manage order history for customers and administrators.
  
- **Product Management**
  - Add, update, or delete food items for the hotel.
  - Fetch available food items.
  - Filter food items by categories such as popular or recommended.
  
- **Customer Management**
  - Create, update, and delete customer profiles.
  - Retrieve customer information and history.
  
- **Reporting**
  - Generate statistics on the most ordered food, customer activity, and sales.

## Technologies

- **Java 17**: Latest version of Java for modern language features and better performance.
- **Spring Boot**: Framework used for rapid development, API creation, and security.
- **Spring Security**: Handles authentication and authorization with JWT tokens.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing product, customer, and order data due to its flexibility and scalability.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and project build tool.

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the backend locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Java 17
- Maven
- MongoDB (local or cloud instance)
- Postman (optional for API testing)

### Running the Backend

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/food-order-backend.git
   cd food-order-backend

2. Install the project dependencies using Maven:

   ```bash
   mvn clean install

3. Configure MongoDB connection:

Edit the application.properties file to configure your MongoDB URI if using a remote MongoDB server.
By default, it connects to localhost.

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run

5. The backend should now be running at http://localhost:8080.


## Testing APIs

You can use Postman to manually test the API endpoints:

1. Open Postman and import the provided Postman collection (food-order.postman_collection.json).

2. Set the base URL to http://localhost:8080.

3. Add necessary headers, including the Authorization header for protected routes:
   ```bash
   Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>

## Future Enhancements

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrate support for online payments through platforms like Stripe or PayPal.
Customer Feedback: Enable customers to leave feedback or rate food items.
Reservation Management: Extend the system to manage room reservations as part of hotel services.
